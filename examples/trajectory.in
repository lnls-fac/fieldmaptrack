# --- Summary ---
#
# This is the input file for trajectory calculation based on a given
# fieldmap which is performed with the script 'fma_trajectory.py'
# A controllable fixed-size Runge-Kutta algorithm is used to integrate
# the equantions of motion of a single electron in the presence of
# the magnetic field as defined in the fieldmap.
#
# The implemented equations of motion are not approximated. Provided
# a sufficiently fine RK step is chosen, this scripts may be used to
# accurately obtain the trajectory of the electron with arbitrary energy
#
# Runge-kutta algorithm used for the integration of the eqs. of motion needs to know
# what to do when trajectory reachs the fieldmap bounds. It will either extrapolate the field
# along the longitudinal (z) direction or consider it to have vanished. 
# As for the transverse directions (x and y), the RK algorithm will 
# generate exceptions.

# A trajectory can also be read from file. This is useful when the fieldmap of
# 3D models with errors are being analysed. In this case we want to use as reference
# trajectory a trajectory that was calculated from the 3D model without errors and
# saved to file. If parameter 'traj_load_filename' is set to 'None' then a new
# refernence trajectory with be calculated with RK on the given fieldmap.

# fieldmap so that the total trajectory deflection will exactly match the nominal deflection

# The RK algorithm always integrates the trajectory from the center of the magnet (z = s = 0 mm)

# If only 'traj_rk_s_step' is given then the algorithm will integrate until
# the z coordinate of the particle reaches the fieldmap bound.
