# --- Summary ---
#
# this is the input file for the fma_multipoles.py script
# this script calculates the multipoles around the reference trajectory.


# --- Input parameters ---

# each analysis has an identity label used for naming output files

# integrated residual field (converted to kick angle) calculated from fitted multipoles and 
# from integrated fieldmap are compared. The parameter below lists the monomials which are 
# supposed to define the main field. The rest makes up for the residual field
