# --- Summary ---
#
# this is the input file for the fma_multipoles.py script
# this script calculates the multipoles around the reference trajectory.


# --- Input parameters ---

# each analysis has an identity label used for naming output files

# the multipoles (m1,m2,...) to be calculated are defined by a list of position x exponents (n1,n2,...):
# By = m1 * x^n1 + m2 * x^n2 + ...

  multipoles_perpendicular_grid     np.linspace(-10,10,41)          # grid of points on perpendicular line to ref trajectory [mm]

# after multipole coeffs are calculated, their normalized strengths at perp. position r0 are calculated (as defined in tracy)

# integrated residual field (converted to kick angle) calculated from fitted multipoles and
# from integrated fieldmap are compared. The parameter below lists the monomials which are
# supposed to define the main field. The rest makes up for the residual field
